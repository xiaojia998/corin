## Introduction

Corin is a 64-key keyboard that adds 4 more arrow keys than a regular 60% keyboard, and has Home and End buttons next to the arrow keys. The laminated LEDs provide a great visual experience and this is the best keyboard for software development engineers (and maintenance engineers as well)!

The PCB is powered by a ATMEGA32U4-AU and is QMK compatible.

Use WS2812-3528 for LEDs on the PCB, which can be configured as per the QMK capabilities.
